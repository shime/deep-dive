  <h2> 404: Page not found </h2>

  <p class="mt-4">
    A bunch of words,</br>
    On this link they stood,</br>
    Someone hoped they're here,</br>
    But it didn't turn out good.</br>
  </p>

  <p class="mt-4">
    Rage not and don't despair,</br>
    The mighty <a href="/">archive</a></br>
    is where you'll find all that's there.</br>
  </p>

  <p class="mt-4">
    And excuse this poor soul,</br>
    For sometimes being such a troll.</br>
  </p>
